# C Programming Portfolio — Project-Based Learning


This repository is a curated collection of real-world C programming projects, written from scratch to demonstrate practical mastery of core and advanced C concepts. Each project is scoped to reflect industry-relevant patterns, with clean, testable, and well-documented code.


> 💡 **Purpose**: Build deep, demonstrable expertise in C through applied projects.  
> 📌 **Goal**: Strengthen systems-level thinking, improve performance-oriented coding, and establish a consistent portfolio of real technical work.

## 📚 Learning Approach

- ✅ **Concept → Implementation**: Every C topic (variables, loops, functions, memory, structs, etc.) is reinforced with one or more real projects.
- 🧩 **Hands-On Problem Solving**: Projects include utilities, simulations, and command-line tools.
- 🔄 **Daily Push Strategy**: Targeting 2–3 projects per day to reinforce practice and showcase consistent growth.
- 🧪 **Minimal boilerplate**: Focused on clean, modern C with precision and portability in mind.
